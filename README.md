# spaCy Models for Latin

## Models
- [la_core_cltk_sm](https://github.com/diyclassics/latin-spacy-models/tree/main/la_core_cltk_sm): pipeline with POS tagger, lemmatizer, morphologizer, and dependency parser trained on combined Latin UD treebanks

## Development
This is part of my larger work on adding Latin as a language to spaCy. Please see: https://github.com/diyclassics/spaCy/tree/latin-dev.
